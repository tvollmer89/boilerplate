Since the 1960s, the company has been at the helm of this industry by introducing self-curing inorganic zinc-rich primers to market. Before this innovation, zinc-rich primers had to be cured by misting water onto the surface of the coating until it reached a satisfactory hardness. Only three mils of Carboline’s premier Carbozinc coating was used to protect the launch tower at Cape Kennedy Space Center for more than 50 years. Carboline recently won an industry award for the longevity of that project, along with a closet full of other awards for zinc-rich coating projects.",
